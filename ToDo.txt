ToDo:

CORE:
=====

- Save and restore expansion state along playlists
--- Not so easy. xml for each playlistView is generated by the playlist which knows nothing about the state 
	and injecting it afterwards is hard because of the recursiv design of the xml


- add a startAllWaiting command for playlist so that all waiting subplaylist start playing.


- add Try Catch to all command executions


- add image scroller functions to StillPlaylist


- implement playlist trigger
--- alows to trigger the main functions of a playlist like start, stop abort
--- triggers by time, maybe gpio etc. - keep it generic
--- ? triggers by conditions??

---> Moved Version Controll to CasparCGServerConnection - CD 04/08/13

- Idee: Statt timer für playlist, einfach nur atualisieren wenn ein changed event gefeuert wurde...
---> geht nicht, bzw. nur schwer. Dann müssten alle Playlists die nicht via MediaUpdater updates bekommen eigene timer führen etc. 
---> Dann lieber einen timer für alle

Done - CD 14/08/13
